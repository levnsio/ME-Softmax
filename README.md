Title: Learnable Boundary Enhanced Softmax Layer Based on Gray Morphology for Data-driven Image Segmentation.


This project proposes the boundary enhanced Softmax layer based on gray morphology in a variational perspective, which is controllable, differentiable, learnable and interpretable. We will publish the code after the paper is accepted.
